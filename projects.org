* GNU Guile
  I know several programming languages, but in my view Lisp (and especially
  Scheme) is the most elegant and clean language among them.  So I wrote some
  free software libraries for GNU Guile, the Scheme implementation of my choice,
  to help the language grow and mature.

  - [[./projects/guile-ssh/index.html][Guile-SSH]] -- libssh bindings for GNU Guile.
  - [[./projects/guile-smc/][Guile-SMC ]]-- GNU Guile State Machine Compiler.
  - [[https://github.com/artyom-poptsov/guile-dsv][Guile-DSV]] -- Delimiter-separated values (DSV) format parser for GNU Guile.
  - [[./projects/guile-ics/][Guile-ICS]] -- iCalendar (RFC5545) format parser for GNU Guile.
  - [[https://github.com/artyom-poptsov/guile-png][Guile-PNG]] -- Portable Network Graphics (RFC2083) library.
  - [[https://github.com/artyom-poptsov/guile-udev][Guile-Udev]] -- GNU Guile bindings to libudev.
  - [[https://github.com/artyom-poptsov/guile-deck][Guile-Deck]] -- GNU Guile Matrix network SDK.
  - [[https://github.com/artyom-poptsov/guile-gitlab][Guile-GitLab]] -- GNU Guile interface to GitLab CE REST API.

* Other
  - [[https://gitlab.com/gkaz/mst][mst]] -- Multi-Seat Tookit that allows to create multi-seat configurations
    using graphical interface.  I'm developing this project as part of my job in
    "AZ" Company Group LLC.
  - [[https://gitlab.com/gkaz/azbook][azbook]] -- File synchronization and authentication system that allows to log
    in to a GNU/Linux system with an ID from cloud services that support the
    WebDAV protocol (nextCloud, ownCloud, ...)  The system keeps local user
    files in sync with the server storage.  I'm developing this project as part
    of my job in "AZ" Company Group LLC.
