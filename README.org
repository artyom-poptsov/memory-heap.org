My personal web site that's made with an (un)healthy portion of Emacs Lisp.  The
live version of it most likely lives here: https://memory-heap.org/~avp/

** How to build
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE shell
$ make
#+END_EXAMPLE

Obviously you'll need Emacs installed on your system to do that.  The output
will be stored in =output= directory.
